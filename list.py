# introduction to lists exercises

# Create a variable and assign it a list that contains an integer, a float, a Boolean value, a string, and a list of 3 integers.
var = [9, 5.3, True, "Amaan", [3,5,3]]

# Create another variable and assign it a call of the list() function with a string as its argument.
new_var = list("This is new string")

# Use the keyword "in" to check if the letter "e" is in the list assigned to the variable from step 2 and print the result.
print('e' in new_var)

# Use the keyword "not in" to check if the letter "a" is not in the list assigned to the variable from step 2 and print the result.
print("a" in new_var)
