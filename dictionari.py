# introduction to dictionaries exercises

# create a variable and assign it a dictionary that has 5 key value pairs
new = {"one":"none", "2": "abc", "ok":"okay", "four":"4", "5":"five"}

# print and access the value held at the third key in the dictionary
print(new["ok"])

# use the in keyword to check if a key appears in the dictionary and print the result
print("5" in new)

# use not in to check if a key does not appear in the dictionary and print the result
print("four" not in new)
